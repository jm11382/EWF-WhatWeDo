With a project scope confirmed, we collaborate with the NGO to define responsibilities for the preparation, installation, and operation of the project, and with a defined project budget, the Elemental Water Foundation and partnered NGO will begin their fundraising efforts. When full funding is obtained, Elemental Water Foundation will initiate and monitor the execution of the project. Afterwards, the project and its partners are continuously evaluated for maintenance of quality.</p>
